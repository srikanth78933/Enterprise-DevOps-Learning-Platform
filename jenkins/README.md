# Jenkins Setup — Project 3: CI/CD with Helm & Independent Pipelines

One-time setup for the Jenkins controller before `backend/Jenkinsfile` and
`frontend/Jenkinsfile` will run successfully. This extends Project 2's
setup (steps 1-10 below, largely unchanged) with Helm on the agent and two
separate pipeline jobs instead of one (steps 7 and 11).

## 1. Install plugins

Install everything listed in [`plugins.txt`](./plugins.txt) — Manage
Jenkins → Plugins → Available plugins, or via `jenkins-plugin-cli
--plugin-file jenkins/plugins.txt` if you're baking a custom controller image.

## 2. Configure tools

Manage Jenkins → Tools:

| Tool type | Name (must match `backend/Jenkinsfile`) | Version |
|---|---|---|
| JDK | `jdk21` | Temurin 21 |
| Maven | `maven3` | 3.9.x |

(`frontend/Jenkinsfile` doesn't declare a `tools` block — Node isn't
managed as a Jenkins tool here; install it on the agent directly, or use a
`nodejs` plugin tool named to match if you prefer that route.)

## 3. Configure the SonarQube server

Manage Jenkins → System → SonarQube servers → Add:

- Name: `sonarqube-server` (must match `SONARQUBE_ENV` in `backend/Jenkinsfile`)
- Server URL: your SonarQube instance URL
- Server authentication token: create a credential of type "Secret text"
  from a SonarQube-generated token, select it here

Then, in SonarQube itself: Administration → Webhooks → add a webhook
pointing at `http://<jenkins-url>/sonarqube-webhook/`. Without this, the
`waitForQualityGate` step will time out after 10 minutes instead of
returning immediately. (Only `backend/Jenkinsfile` uses SonarQube —
there's no equivalent gate on the frontend pipeline in this project.)

## 4. Add Docker Hub credentials

Manage Jenkins → Credentials → add a "Username with password" credential:

- ID: `dockerhub-credentials` (must match both Jenkinsfiles)
- Username / Password: your Docker Hub username and an access token
  (Docker Hub → Account Settings → Security → New Access Token — do not use
  your account password)

## 5. Docker on the agent

The agent running these pipelines needs a working `docker` CLI. If Jenkins
itself runs in a container, mount the host's Docker socket:

```bash
docker run -d --name jenkins \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

(Also install the `docker` CLI binary inside that same Jenkins container —
the Jenkins image does not ship it by default.)

## 6. Update the image names

Edit `BACKEND_IMAGE` in `backend/Jenkinsfile` and `FRONTEND_IMAGE` in
`frontend/Jenkinsfile` to your own Docker Hub namespace before running
either pipeline against a real registry.

## 7. Create two pipeline jobs (not one)

- New Item → `enterprise-backend-pipeline` → Pipeline → "Pipeline script
  from SCM" → Git → this repo URL, branch `project-03-cicd-helm-microservices`,
  script path `backend/Jenkinsfile`
- New Item → `enterprise-frontend-pipeline` → same repo/branch, script
  path `frontend/Jenkinsfile`

Each can be triggered independently (e.g. via separate webhook path
filters watching `backend/**` vs `frontend/**`, if you want push-triggered
builds that don't fire on unrelated changes).

## 8. Add AWS credentials

Provision an IAM user (or better, a role your Jenkins host can assume) with
permissions to call `eks:DescribeCluster` and to manage the EKS cluster's
Kubernetes RBAC (the IAM identity running `aws eks update-kubeconfig` must
also be mapped to a Kubernetes RBAC role — by default, whichever identity
created the cluster via Terraform already has `system:masters`; grant others
access via the `aws-auth` ConfigMap if needed).

Manage Jenkins → Credentials → add two "Secret text" credentials:

- ID: `aws-access-key-id` — value: the IAM user's access key ID
- ID: `aws-secret-access-key` — value: the IAM user's secret access key

(A minimal setup for learning. Production setups should use short-lived
STS credentials via an OIDC-federated Jenkins identity instead of a static
IAM user key — a Project 10 concern.)

## 9. Install `kubectl`, `helm`, and the `aws` CLI on the agent

```bash
# inside the Jenkins container/agent
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
install -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod +x get_helm.sh && ./get_helm.sh

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip && ./aws/install
```

## 10. Update cluster/region constants

If you changed `project_name`, `environment`, or `aws_region` in
`terraform/terraform.tfvars` from their defaults, update `EKS_CLUSTER_NAME`
and `AWS_REGION` at the top of both Jenkinsfiles to match — they must be
the exact `cluster_name` Terraform output value.

## 11. Create the secrets and bootstrap the release once

Before either pipeline's first run, follow
[`helm/enterprise-app/README.md`](../helm/enterprise-app/README.md) to
create `backend-secret` and `mysql-secret`. Both Jenkinsfiles use
`helm upgrade --install ... --reuse-values`, so either pipeline can safely
perform the very first install too — you don't strictly need to run
`scripts/helm-install.sh` manually first, but doing so once lets you
confirm the chart installs cleanly before wiring up Jenkins.

## Maven settings.xml

See [`settings.xml.example`](./settings.xml.example) — it documents the
`pluginGroups` entry needed for the bare `mvn sonar:sonar` goal to resolve.
Do not commit a real `settings.xml` with credentials; use Jenkins' Config
File Provider plugin instead.
